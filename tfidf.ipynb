    "Below is a representative sentence from one essay:\n",

    "While the written language is straighforward for a human reader to evaluate, an automated system will need to translate the written word into a more machine-friendly format that will allow us to use data science techniques to grade the essays. The algorithm we have chosen is called term frequency-inverse document frequency, or **tf-idf** (\"term frequency\" because it emphasizes words that appear often in a particular essay, and \"inverse document frequency\" because it penalizes words that appear often in all documents). Essentially, this method takes as an input a set of text (in our case an essay) and *vectorizes* it, outputting a vector of numbers corresponding to that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this output vector, a **tf-idf** algorithm counts the number of times a word appears in a document and scales it according to the formula\n",

    "$$\n",
    "w_{j,i} = tf_{j,i} \\cdot \\log\\frac{N}{df_i},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $tf_{i,j}$ is the number of times term $i$ occurs in essay $j$, $N$ is the total number of essays, $df_i$ is the number of documents containing term $i$, and $w_{j,i}$ is the tf-idf weighted term vector for this sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## EXAMPLES GO HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating these vectors for every essay and stacking them on top of one another provides **tf-idf matrix**, a straightforward method for letting a computer handle text. Conveniently, taking any column from this matrix gives the (weighted) number of times a given word appears in each essay. Taking every column into account, we can now build a model that scores an essay based on the *word-content* of that essay.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TO DO:\n",
    "- Add in a couple example matrices based on the sentence above. I'm having a bit of trouble making it come out right (see `tfidf_example.py`)"
