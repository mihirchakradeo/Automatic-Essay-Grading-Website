    "- Syntax complexity\n",
    "    - We could extract features that represent syntax complexity such as length of clases, amount of embedding or subordination, amount of coordination, range of surface syntactic structures. There are some tools available for this. ([L2 Syntatic Complexity Analyzer](http://www.personal.psu.edu/xxl13/downloads/l2sca.html), [TAASSC](http://www.kristopherkyle.com/taassc.html))\n",

    "For statistical models, we've also tested logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier for classifying the score. However, the performance (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients ($\\rho$) and $R^2$) was worse than our baseline multiple linear regression. \n",
    "We would also like to try other models such as Random Forest Classifier/Regressor and neural networks."
