      <h2 >It is college application season.</h2>

      <p class="lead">Across the country four million students will be
      submitting upwards of forty million applications (<a href=
      "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/nyregion/applications-by-the-dozen-as-anxious-students-hedge-college-bets.html">source</a>)
      and then fretting until late March to find the results. Our
      team at Harvard's Data Science Class has analyzed more than
      13,000 applications to determine which factors matter most to
      the top twenty-five colleges in the USA. We have also built
      an <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">online predictor</a>
      that lets a student or parent enter current results, see the
      chances of getting into an elite college. Even more
      importantly, the student can then change the values to see if
      time is better spent improving grades or playing more varsity
      sports.</p>

      <p>Let's see how one student Morgan, a math-savvy junior, can
      use <a href="http://www.chanceme.info/">our website</a> to
      decide where to spend her time.</p>

      <p>We hope to provide some clarity, precision and reasonably accurate
        forecasting of a student's probability of being accepted into a given
        college. On the one hand, future applicants and their parents can
        browse through our data analyses to explore how their university of
        interest compares to others. We want to show them how the schools
        perform in the sense of gender equality and minorities or how important
        it is to go to a private highschool.  Next, they can use our predictive
        model, which is available on a <a href="www.chanceme.info"> publicly

      <p>Standardized tests, GPA and the school the student is
      applying to are by far the most important factors that determine
      admission success. This should come as no surprise. What is
      surprising is how little other factors matter. Sports can be
      <a href="http://collegepuzzle.stanford.edu/?p=2088">a huge time sink</a>
      yet make no difference to a successful admission. Unless the
      student is a star recruited athlete, a fraction of the time
      spent on sports would be better spent improving standardized
      tests, especially the SAT or ACT score.</p>

      <p>Being an underrepresented minority (Hispanic,
      African-American, Native American) provides an average boost
      to the candidate's SAT or ACT by 87 points. This can make a
      huge difference when the schools are so competitive. However,
      this advantage varies significantly by school. Carnegie
      Mellon gives the greatest boost to minorities, with an
      average increase of 149 points. Harvard is notably the only
      of the top twenty-five that has statistically no premium
      given to underrepresented minorities.</p>

      <p>Most of these elite schools claim to be "needs blind."
      Their admission decision is not supposed to factor in the
      ability of the candidate to pay. Our analysis showed this
      indeed to be the case: whether or not the candidate needed
      financial assistance had no affect on the acceptance
      decision. <strong>The acceptance rates, when all other
      factors were accounted for, remained the same irrespective of
      whether the student was able to pay full tuition or
      not.</strong></p>

      <p>Some private
      schools have annual tuition as much as college although for
      twelve years instead of four. For example, $30,000 per year
      invested at 5% over 12 years means cumulative cost of almost
      half a million dollars.</p>

      <p>As you can see in the following chart, students at private
      schools have an advantage in the most critical aspects for
      college admissions. The differences appear slight, but when
      twenty points in SAT score can make the difference between
      acceptance and rejection, the results are pronounced.</p>

      <p>Most of us have an intuitive sense about which factors of an
        application are most important for determining admissions. However,
        things get murky when we start to think about how each college might
        differentially weight the factors. Much of the uncertainty surrounding
        applying to Ivy League schools arises from the seeming randomness of
        admissions-- why should a 4.0 student with high SAT scores get into
        Harvard, but not Princeton or Yale? We aimed to quantify some over this
        inter-college variation.

        We asked whether being a legacy had different levels of importance in
        determining admissions across our 25 schools. We find that although
        legacy has a positive effect on admission at every school, it is
        especially important at the Ivy League schools, as well as at Stanford
        and MIT.</p>

        <p>Our results confirm the conventional wisdom that technical schools

          females, are more likely to admit women.</p>

      <p>We have provided some much-needed insight into the murky waters of the
        college admissions process. Our hope is that this information empowers
        students and their supporters to make informed decisions about
        priorities and factors to consider when applying to college. Clearly,
        SAT scores and GPA are the most important factors of an application.
        Students should focus on boosting their academic profiles in lieu of
        joining more and more extracurricular activities.  There are some
        limitations to our approach given the structure of our dataset.
        For example, we are unable to take account of any personal statements
        or recommendation letters, which are obviously very important in the
        application procedure. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
        analysis is the most extensive open-source tool available to high
        school students to date.</p>
